# Movie Data Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze movie data from various datasets, including IMDb, BOM, RT, TMDB, and TN. 
The analysis is conducted using Python and its data manipulation and visualization libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Datasets
The following datasets were used in this analysis:

im.db: SQLite database containing IMDb data, including movie basics and ratings.
bom.movie_gross.csv.gz: Compressed CSV file containing box office gross revenue data from BOM.
rt.movie_info.tsv.gz and rt.reviews.tsv.gz: Compressed TSV files containing movie information and reviews data from RT.
tmdb.movies.csv.gz: Compressed CSV file containing movie data from TMDB.
tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz: Compressed CSV file containing movie budget data from TN.

Data Analysis Steps

Data Preprocessing: The datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing data, convert data types, and format data appropriately for analysis. The code for data preprocessing can be found in the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.

Data Analysis:
The cleaned and preprocessed data was analyzed to derive insights and findings. This included examining movie genres distribution and ratings in IMDb data, domestic gross revenue trends in BOM data, movie studio distribution in RT info data, and other relevant insights. The code for data analysis can be found in the data_analysis.ipynb notebook.

Visualization of Results:
Visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots were used to effectively communicate the findings of the data analysis. The visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python. The code for visualizations can be found in the data_visualization.ipynb notebook.

Recommendations
Based on the data analysis findings, the following recommendations are proposed for the movie industry:

Recommendation 1: Focus on producing movies in genres with high demand, as identified in the IMDb data analysis.
Recommendation 2: Invest in marketing and distribution strategies to boost domestic gross revenue, as suggested by the BOM data analysis.
Recommendation 3: Collaborate with movie studios with a strong distribution network, as revealed in the RT info data analysis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this data analysis project provides insights and recommendations for the movie industry based on the analysis of multiple datasets. The findings and recommendations can be used by movie industry stakeholders, such as production companies, studios, and marketers, to inform decision-making and improve business strategies.
